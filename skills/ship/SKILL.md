# Ship

The endgame, once the work is done and `/review` has been through it: commits worth reading, a PR that explains itself, and a merge that keeps both.

This skill names the commands rather than describing them. The flags carry the decisions — `--rebase` rather than `--squash` is the difference between seven commits on `main` and one — so leaving them to be re-derived each time is how a decision quietly reverses.

This skill never merges without being told to. Every stop — merge, or a situation it doesn't expect — is a question asked with the AskUserQuestion tool, never one written in the reply: a pending question notifies the user in the Remote Control app, a reply that just ends does not.

## Process

### 1. Preflight

Five checks, all cheap, each catching a different way this goes wrong:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD          # which branch
git status --short                        # is the tree clean
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD       # what is unpushed
gh auth status                            # can we open a PR at all
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '{default_branch,allow_rebase_merge,allow_auto_merge,delete_branch_on_merge}'
```

Read the base branch from `gh api`, **not** from `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` — that ref is unset in this clone and `git symbolic-ref` on it simply fails.

**If HEAD is the default branch**, stop and rescue rather than pushing. The work is not lost and does not need redoing — provided nothing has been pushed yet:

```bash
git switch -c <type>/<issue>-<slug>   # the branch now points at the work
git branch -f main origin/main         # main goes back to where the remote has it
```

Confirm `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` still lists the work before going on. If the commits were already pushed to the default branch, say so and ask with AskUserQuestion how to proceed — rewriting published history is the user's call, not yours.

### 2. Shape the commits

The step that needs judgement, and the reason this is a skill and not a script.

If the work is one undifferentiated commit, or several commits that only make sense together, rebuild it. `git reset --soft <base>` puts every change back in the index without touching a file, and the pieces can then be committed in order.

What makes the layering right:

- **Dependency order, bottom up.** A module before the thing that imports it; the schema before the code that writes to it; test infrastructure before the tests that use it.
- **Each commit is one reason.** A commit that changes a module *and* renames something unrelated is two commits.
- **Each commit stands alone.** It passes the checks with nothing after it applied. Do not assert this — check it, with the checks for the areas touched (`CLAUDE.md § Agent skills`):

  ```bash
  for sha in $(git rev-list --reverse <base>..HEAD); do
    git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout -q "$sha"
    <the area's checks>
  done
  git checkout -q <branch>
  ```

- **The tree is unchanged by the restructuring.** `git diff <original-sha> HEAD` must be empty. If it is not, the split dropped something.

Messages follow the repo's own voice — read `git log` before writing one. Here: a sentence-case subject that says what the change is *for* rather than what it touches, and a body that argues the reasoning rather than restating the diff. End with the attribution trailer the harness gives for this session, naming the model actually running (`Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`).

### 3. Push and open the PR

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --base <default-branch> --head <branch> --title "<subject>" --body-file -
```

The body is drawn from the ticket, not invented: what it does, the decisions worth not re-deriving, anything the review changed, how to verify it, and anything deliberately left undone. Include `Closes #N` so the ticket closes itself on merge. Name the commits and what each one is, since the whole point of shaping them is that somebody can read them. End with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.

### 4. Checks

**This repo has no CI.** `gh pr checks <n>` will report nothing — say so plainly rather than reading it as green. The gate is step 2's per-commit loop, which already ran the checks on every commit; if it didn't, run them on HEAD now and report the result.

If workflows appear later, the three outcomes are genuinely different: **green** → step 5; **red** → stop, report which check failed and what it said, do not merge and do not ask to; **no checks reported** → say so plainly; it is the user's call whether that is expected.

### 5. Ask before merging

Report the PR link, the check state, and the commits as they will land. Then ask with AskUserQuestion: **"Merge PR #N — rebase, delete branch"** (Recommended) / **"Not yet"**.

Wait for the tap. A green PR is not permission.

### 6. Land it

```bash
gh pr merge <n> --rebase --delete-branch
```

`--rebase` because the layering from step 2 is the deliverable; a squash discards it and puts one commit on the default branch. `--delete-branch` unless preflight showed `delete_branch_on_merge` already on. `--auto` only when `allow_auto_merge` is true *and* the user asked to queue behind checks.

Then bring the local default branch back in line. A rebase merge rewrites the SHAs, so a pull would try to reconcile two versions of the same commits:

```bash
git checkout <default-branch>
git fetch --prune origin
git reset --hard origin/<default-branch>
```

Confirm afterwards: the commits are on the default branch, the tree is clean, and the checks pass there.

### 7. Report what comes next

Not a summary of what just happened — the user watched that. What to do next:

- **What this ticket left unfinished.** Verification steps its own ticket listed that have not been run yet, especially anything needing credentials or a live service.
- **What it unblocks.** Read it from the tracker (`gh issue list --label ready-for-agent`), do not guess. Say which tickets are ready now and why.
- **Debts left in the code.** Every `# lazy:` marker this branch added, with its ceiling and trigger (`/debt` lists them all), and anything else deliberately deferred and where it is written down.
- **Judgement calls worth revisiting**, if the review raised something you decided against.

## When the tree is not what you expected

Stop and ask with AskUserQuestion rather than working around it. Uncommitted changes you did not make, a branch that has diverged from its remote, a merge conflict against the base — each of these means the situation is not the one this process assumes, and a guess here costs more than a question.
